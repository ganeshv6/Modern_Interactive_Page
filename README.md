**Modern Interactive Page**<br>
A responsive and dynamic single-page application (SPA) built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
This project showcases modern web design techniques, including the Glassmorphism UI style, smooth content interactions, and integration with external APIs for real-time data.<br><br>
**Key Features**<br>
Glassmorphism UI - CSS3 : Utilizes backdrop-filter and semi-transparent backgrounds to achieve a sleek, frosted glass effect across the hero section and main UI elements.<br>
Full Responsiveness - Media Queries : Implements a mobile-first approach, ensuring seamless layout, font, and component adjustments across all devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).<br>
Dynamic Image Carousel - JavaScript (Vanilla) : An interactive image gallery with "Next/Previous" controls and dot navigation. Displays dynamic descriptions tied to the currently viewed image.<br>
Dynamic Weather Forecast - JavaScript & OpenWeatherMap API : Fetches and displays detailed weather information (temperature, wind, humidity, pressure) for a user-specified city via an input field.<br>
Interactive Joke Generator - JavaScript & Joke API : Features a dedicated "Generate a Joke" button to fetch and display random jokes on demand.<br>
Stacked API Layout - CSS Flexbox : Organizes the dynamic content (Weather and Joke panels) in a clean, vertical, full-width stack for optimal readability and mobile performance.<br><br>
**Project Structure**<br>
index.html: The structure of the page, including the Hero section, Image Carousel, and API containers with the required input fields and buttons.<br>
style.css: Contains all styling, including Glassmorphism effects, responsive design rules, and visual enhancements for the API data sections.<br>
script.js: Houses all the dynamic logic, including the Image Carousel function, the two separate API fetching functions (fetchWeatherData, fetchJokeData), and all event listeners (search button, joke button, carousel arrows).<br><br>
